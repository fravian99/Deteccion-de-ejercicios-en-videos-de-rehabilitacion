	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we present an interactive dancing game based on motion capture technology. We address the problem of real-time recognition of the user's live dance performance in order to determine the interactive motion to be rendered by a virtual dance partner. The real-time recognition algorithm is based on a human body partition indexing scheme with flexible matching to determine the end of a move as well as to detect unwanted motion. We show that the system can recognize the live dance motions of users with good accuracy and render the interactive dance move of the virtual partner. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract="Telemedicine is a current trend in healthcare. The present study is part of the ePHoRt project, which is a web-based platform for the rehabilitation of patients after hip replacement surgery. To be economically suitable the system is intended to be based on low-cost technologies, especially in terms of motion capture. This is the reason why the Kinect-based motion tracking is chosen. The paper focuses on the automatic assessment of the correctness of the exercises performed by the user. A Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach is used to discriminate between correct and incorrect movements. The classification of the movements through a Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier shows a very high percentage of accuracy (98.2{\%}). Models are built for each individual and reeducation exercise with only few attributes and the same accuracy. Due to these promising results, the next step will consist of testing the algorithms on patients performing the exercises in real time.",

	ABSTRACT = {Older people face difficulty engaging in conventional rehabilitation exercises for improving physical functions over a long time period due to the passive nature of the conventional exercise, inconvenience, and cost. This study aims to develop and validate a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for assessing Kinect-enabled home-based physical rehabilitation exercises, in order to support auto-coaching in a virtual gaming environment. A DTW-based algorithm was first applied to compute motion similarity between two time series from an individual user and a virtual coach. We chose eight bone vectors of the human skeleton and body orientation as the input features and proposed a simple but innovative method to further convert the DTW distance to a meaningful performance score in terms of the percentage (0–100%), without training data and experience of experts. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated through a follow-up experiment with 21 subjects when playing a Tai Chi exergame. Results showed that the algorithm scores had a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.86) with experts’ ratings and the calibrated algorithm scores were comparable to the gold standard. These findings suggested that the DTW-based algorithm could be effectively used for automatic performance evaluation of an individual when performing home-based rehabilitation exercises.},
