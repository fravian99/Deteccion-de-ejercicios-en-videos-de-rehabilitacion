Specifically, this manuscript contributes to the literature by improving upon the use towards lead-lag estimation. Our two-step procedure computes the multi-dimensional DTW alignment with the aid of shapeDTW and then utilises the output to extract the estimated time-varying lead-lag relationship between the original time series. Next, our extensive simulation study analyses the performance of the algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art methods Thermal Optimal Path (TOP), Symmetric Thermal Optimal Path (TOPS), Rolling Cross-Correlation (RCC), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and Derivative Dynamic Time Warping (DDTW). We observe a strong outperformance of the algorithm regarding efficiency, robustness, and feasibility.},

	ABSTRACT = {Older people face difficulty engaging in conventional rehabilitation exercises for improving physical functions over a long time period due to the passive nature of the conventional exercise, inconvenience, and cost. This study aims to develop and validate a dynamic time warping (DTW) based algorithm for assessing Kinect-enabled home-based physical rehabilitation exercises, in order to support auto-coaching in a virtual gaming environment. A DTW-based algorithm was first applied to compute motion similarity between two time series from an individual user and a virtual coach. We chose eight bone vectors of the human skeleton and body orientation as the input features and proposed a simple but innovative method to further convert the DTW distance to a meaningful performance score in terms of the percentage (0–100%), without training data and experience of experts. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was validated through a follow-up experiment with 21 subjects when playing a Tai Chi exergame. Results showed that the algorithm scores had a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.86) with experts’ ratings and the calibrated algorithm scores were comparable to the gold standard. These findings suggested that the DTW-based algorithm could be effectively used for automatic performance evaluation of an individual when performing home-based rehabilitation exercises.},

We address the problem of real-time recognition of the user's live dance performance in order to determine the interactive motion to be rendered by a virtual dance partner. The real-time recognition algorithm is based on a human body partition indexing scheme with flexible matching to determine the end of a move as well as to detect unwanted motion. We show that the system can recognize the live dance motions of users with good accuracy and render the interactive dance move of the virtual partner. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The present study is part of the ePHoRt project, which is a web-based platform for the rehabilitation of patients after hip replacement surgery. To be economically suitable the system is intended to be based on low-cost technologies, especially in terms of motion capture. This is the reason why the Kinect-based motion tracking is chosen. The paper focuses on the automatic assessment of the correctness of the exercises performed by the user. A Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach is used to discriminate between correct and incorrect movements. The classification of the movements through a Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier shows a very high percentage of accuracy (98.2{\%}). Models are built for each individual and reeducation exercise with only few attributes and the same accuracy. Due to these promising results, the next step will consist of testing the algorithms on patients performing the exercises in real time.",

	ABSTRACT = {Over the past few years, software applications for medical assistance, including tele-rehabilitation, have known an increasing presence in the health arena. Despite the several therapeutic and economic advantages of this new paradigm, it is important to follow certain guidelines, in order to build a safe, useful, scalable, and ergonomic tool. This work proposes to address all these points, through the case study of a physical tele-rehabilitation platform for patients after hip replacement surgery. The scalability and versatility of the system is handled by the implementation of a modular architecture. The safeness and effectiveness of the tool is ensured by an artificial intelligence module that assesses the quality of the movements performed by the user. The usability of the application is evaluated by a cognitive walkthrough method. Results show that the system (i) is able to properly assess the correctness of the human’s motion through two possible methods (Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Model), and (ii) provides a good user experience. The discussion addresses (i) the advantages and disadvantages of the main approaches for a gesture recognition of therapeutic movements, and (ii) critical aspects to provide the patient with the best usability of a tele-rehabilitation platform.},
